**Project Description**: Rent A Car
I have made a simple but a robust Car rental system and tried to use as many java concepts as I can found them necessary to use in the project. This Car Rental System, Rent A Car is a console-based application developed in Java to manage car rentals, customer data, and rental periods.
The system allows customers to rent available cars for a specified period, return cars, and manage customer registrations and gives different payment options. I  request everyone to try & test it once and share your honest feedback on slack.

**Key Features**:
Car Management:
Admin can add cars to the system with unique identifiers, brands, models, and availability status.

Customer Management:
Users can register themselves as customers by providing essential information such as name, email, address, age, and driving license details.

Rental Process:
Customers can select cars based on availability and specify rental periods.
The application checks for car availability and confirms the rental details.

Payment Processing:
Users can choose from various payment methods (Credit Card, Debit Card, GPay).
A countdown timer ensures users complete their payment within a specified timeframe (2 minutes).
The application confirms whether the payment was completed and only then updates the car's availability status.

Car Return:
Users can return rented cars, updating the car's status to available.

User-Friendly Interface:
The application provides a menu-driven interface that guides users through various options with a scope of suture enhancement like integration payment gateways.
