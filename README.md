# rent-a-car
 I have made a simple but a robust Car rental system and tried to use as many java concepts as I can found them necessary to use in the project. This Car Rental System, Rent A Car is a console-based application developed in Java to manage car rentals, customer data, and rental periods and provides different payment options.
